# Dealio - A better Deal App

The app is similar to any social media app like Facebook or Twitter but unlike those app, what makes this app special is that users posts deals/products that they have encountered on the internet and recommends it to other users.

For example lets suppose a user is shopping online at BestBuy and he sees an extremely amazing deal on a LG tv. The user posts the deal on the app so that other users can also can benefit from the deal and save money.

So that question arises that why would one recommend to other users. Once a user posts a deal and when other users use that deal/link to buy the product, the user will be able to earn points. These points can be changed into money that he or she can use to buy other products on the internet through this app.
